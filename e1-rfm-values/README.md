# E1: RFM Values

The SPD data of our DDR5 UDIMMs were obtained by our SPD decoder (`dump_spd_pretty.py` script), see the accompanying [README](https://github.com/mcsee-artifacts/spd-decoder/) for details.

We provide in `mcsee-data/e1-rfm-values/spd-decoder-output` the decoded SPD data from the DDR5 DIMMs in our test pool.
